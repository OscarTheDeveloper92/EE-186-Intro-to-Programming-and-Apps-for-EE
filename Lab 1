/*
As discussed in class, you will be expanding upon the introduction assignment now that you have an idea of how the printf() command works. 
Please create a new program that will print out an emoticon on the console. You may format it however you like (one really long printf() or 
multiple smaller printf() commands) but it must be at least three to four lines tall. It must have some recognizable shape and you can use any 
of the available shapes or symbols. Avoid using an excessive number of printf() commands. For example, if there were 100 printf() calls but 
the output is only 20 lines tall, there is an issue with how you split up things to be printed. An example of an emotion is listed below
*/
//New Lab #1 Emoticon

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("This is my star :) \n");
    printf("   /\\   \n  <  >\n   VV");

    return 0;
}
