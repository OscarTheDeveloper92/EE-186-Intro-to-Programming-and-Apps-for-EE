/* The program accepts 3 inputs from the user, all integers
 * First input: number of loops
 * Second input: initial value to perform calculations with
 * Third inpout: the amount to add by on each loop
 * It will have the same output text as it iterates
 * Add final message with the final value once done with execution*/
